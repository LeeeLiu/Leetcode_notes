### 11. Container With Most Water
>Medium
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int res=0, i=0, j=height.size()-1;
        while(i<=j)
        {
            res = max(res, min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i));
            if(height[i]>height[j])
                j--;
            else
                i++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
